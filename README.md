Hire.me helps optimize your job search. Just create an account with a valid email, enter a desired job title and location, and Hire.me will scrape multiple job boards and display it for you in a nicely formatted table. Current features that are in development include timed emails that contain scraped jobs for the week, application management and a working api that returns a number of jobs listings in json format.
